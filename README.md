# This is a template repository for python projects

To get started: 
1. Create an environment with python 3.9
2. Adapted the tests and marker. In `pytest.ini` you find a dummy marker as 
    example along with a dummy test case using it in `test/test_dummy.py`
Follow the instructions here to setup the repository [https://github.com/factiverse/factiverse-wiki/wiki/Python-style-guide](https://factiverse.notion.site/Python-d74f39ad8b1649b5868e41ef621f81d8?pvs=4)https://factiverse.notion.site/Python-d74f39ad8b1649b5868e41ef621f81d8?pvs=4
