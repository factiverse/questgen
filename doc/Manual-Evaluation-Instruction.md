**MANUAL EVALUATION**

This file outlines the instructions given to manual evaluators:

PLEASE ONLY EDIT CONTENT ON YOUR OWN GOOGLE SHEET				
There are multiple columns in each of these google sheets. The only columns you need to edit are as follows				
				
Column_Name	        Description			
Covers_all_parts    Does the question cover all parts of the claim			
Natural_Language    Does the question flow like you would read a sentence			
Useful              Does the question seem like a useful question for a question			

     
For each claim, evaluate the above on a scale of 1 thru 5 with 1 being the worst and 5 being the best				
				
You may ignore the `model` column as it should not be used as a metric for your ratings				
Score the model however you see fit. If the model has given a blank response, score that how you wish
