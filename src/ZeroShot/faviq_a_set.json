If so, please read [this](https://cs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/594) first.\n\nAnswer: This problem is called \\em{natural language inference} (NLI). It has been studied extensively by NLP researchers over the past few years. There have also been several shared tasks organized around it, such as [SNLI](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) or [MNLI](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/dkew/mnli/). The latter one contains a large dataset of claims and questions, which can be used to train models."

Are you trying to write an automated program or something like that? If so, then you should probably tag your questions with [tag:programming] as well.\n\nAnswer: \\begin{blockquote}\nYou transform a claim into a question. The question can be understood without reading the claim. You generate exactly one question per claim and nothing else.\n\\end{blockquote}\n\nI don\u2019t understand this part. What does \u201ctransform\u201d mean here? And what does \u201cgenerate\u201d mean in this sentence?\n\nIf you want to ask a question about a statement (claim), you need to first identify the subject and predicate of the statement. Then you can formulate a question by asking who/what performs the action described by the predicate on whom/what. For example, consider the following statements:\n\n\\em{\\strong{\"The 76th season was the last time that the bills won their division.\"}}\n\nHere, \"the 76th season\" is the subject; \"was the last time that the bills won their division\" is the predicate. So, you could ask \"\\strong{When did the 76th season occur?}\". Or, if you wanted more information than just when it occurred, you might ask \"\\strong{What happened during the 76th season?\"}.\n\nAnother example:\n\n\\em{\\strong{\"I could previously use a 'golden age passport' according to the national park service's description of the pass at united states national parks.\"}}\n\nHere, \"I\" is the subject; \"could previously use a 'golden age passport'\" is the predicate."
